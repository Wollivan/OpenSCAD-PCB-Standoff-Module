# OpenSCAD PCB Standoff Module

A module to quickly create standoffs for your PCB in OpenSCAD for you 3D models.

As it stands, the pcbWidth and length is actually the distance between the holes on the board, and not the actual size of the PCB itself.
I am looking for an elegant solution to give the pcb width and the hole location without adding too much complication to the module parameters. Any ideas are most welcome!
